A collection of code snippets for competitive programmers, written in C++ for sublime editor.

Many times this happens in competitive programming competitions that you&#39;ve figured out an algorithm for the solution of the problem, which happens to be a standard algorithm. How helpful would it be to have snippets for commonly used concepts/algorithms in competitive programming in that situation, to provide you an edge over fellow competitors as using snippets will improve your accuracy, speed and hence rank!

This repository provides extension for sublime-text editor which enables sublime users to use c++ coding snippets of algorithms while doing competitive programming.

## Installation

Install using Package Control : Sublime Package manager:

- Ctrl + Shift + P will open command palette
- Type and Select Package Control : Install Package
- Search for Competitive programming sublime snippets and hit enter
